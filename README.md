CS490 Project - Simple online exam taking website

This website was designed to allow students to take Python exams. Instructors would create exams by adding questions to a question
bank and assigning those to a new exam. Students would then take the exams and answer the questions in Python code.

This project consisted of creating a website built using the M-V-C model using POST/JSON to communicate data 
between the different parts. 
As the developer of the "view" part, most of my code involved PHP, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. My PHP code would only interact with
the controller PHP code, created by another group member.
